This will be a test to create a SQL-like way of creating databases, getting data from them and manipulating them in the Command Prompt
of a Windows machine.

It will be using my custom gridclass TUI to display both SQL queries and database information.

could potentially also use a server-web-client model to share and save databases onto a profile. something like git for databases. this is a last step thing tho
