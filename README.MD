This will be a test to create a SQL-like way of creating databases, getting data from them and manipulating them in the Command Prompt
of a Windows machine.

It will be using my custom gridclass TUI to display both SQL queries and database information.

could potentially also use a server-web-client model to share and save databases onto a profile. something like git for databases. this is a last step thing tho

Title screen:

-   Create database
-   Select database
-   Import database
-   Export database

Databases should be in json files when importing. 
for a relational database, that could be its own thing, or have it as a mode to switch between on title
